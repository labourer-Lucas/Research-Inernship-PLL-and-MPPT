\chapter*{Abstract}

This report presents the research and development of power control middleware algorithms, specifically focusing on Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) techniques. The research internship was conducted at Infineon Technologies AG, under the supervision of Dr. Gean Maia de Sousa at the Chair of High-Power Converter Systems, TUM. The objective of this research is to design and evaluate the performance of PLL and MPPT algorithms in power electronic systems, which will finally outcome a repository containing the developed algorithms using Model Based Design (MBD) approach. The outcome can be seen in the GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/labourer-Lucas/Research-Inernship-PLL-and-MPPT}.
